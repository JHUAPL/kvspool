This is a simple logging library. The premise of this library is that
there may be several separate binaries, each having multiple threads,
that should write to one or more logs. To prevent interleaving, we do 
not just write to a common file descriptor (since multiple threads
would interleave their writes). Instead all logging is done by passing
the log messages through a named pipe (aka fifo) to a logd process. 

It is logd's job to read the fifo (whose contents will not be interleaved;
the fifo guarantees atomic writes up to PIPE_MAX bytes). Logd is a separate
process, so it must be running for logging to be effective (otherwise log
messages will be dropped or sent to syslog).

The logd process also allows us to centrally configure logging destinations,
perform log file rotation, and so on.
