kvz is a sample or template application which consumes a spool
but does not have any application specific logic (that is why 
it is a template - you're supposed to fill in application logic).

kvz is a C program that implements a ZeroMQ based main loop, which
polls on ZeroMQ messages from either the spool reader thread or
the control port thread. Thus, it can be connected to using 
zcon and tested interactively using the 'help' commands etc.

A real application would fill in logic in the zmq_poll section
to handle the specific application's spool data and would add new
application-specific commands to kvz_cmds.c.
