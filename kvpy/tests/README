These scripts exercise the kvpy module which reads key-value spools within Python.

read.py    : tries to read one frame from the spool subdirectory 
read_all.py: tries to read all frames from the spool subdirectory 
speed.py   : basic read/write speed test
runtest.sh : invokes another utility to write a frame to the spool then runs read.py
