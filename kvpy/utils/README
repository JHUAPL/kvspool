These scripts exercise the kvpy module which reads key-value spools within Python.

read.py    : tries to read one frame from the spool subdirectory (non-blocking)
read_all.py: tries to read all frames from the spool subdirectory (blocking)
runtest.sh : invokes another utility to write a frame to the spool then runs read.py
